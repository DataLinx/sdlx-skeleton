## About

Eclipse is a PHP app built with Laravel, Livewire and Bootstrap. Its purpose is to offer a solid platform on a modern stack upon which custom web apps can be built. It aims to offer a set of pre-built modules and other generic components which allow a web app for custom project needs to be built quickly and efficiently with little or no boilerplate code.     

It's being developed by [DataLinx](https://www.datalinx.si/), a company in Slovenia/EU, for use in client and own web projects. It's currently in pre-alpha development stage.

This package serves as a starting point and reference for all Eclipse-based PHP projects.

## Requirements
* PHP >= 8.2
  * See the `require` section in [composer.json](composer.json) for required PHP extensions
* MariaDB >= 10.6
* For local development:
  * Node.js with npm
  * Although not obligatory, [Lando](https://lando.dev/) is recommended for setting up the Docker containers. All Eclipse packages already ship with a Lando config file. 

## Getting started
1. Create a new project with composer:
    ```shell
    composer create-project eclipse/skeleton
    ````
2. Run `npm install` in the directory.
3. Run `lando start` and then `lando ssh` to enter into the container. 
4. Run `php artisan eclipse:install` and follow the installation procedure 😎
